# drb-fall25-ml
CU Denver Machine Learning class of Fall 2025 workspace.

## Week 1 (8/19, 8/21)
1. Setup Python 3.10+
2. Create Virtual Environment named `venv-week1`
3. How many rows are in dataset: `week-01/datasets/A.csv`? How about in `week-01/datasets/B.txt` and in
`week-01/datasets/C.csv`? 
4. Repeat the previous task to find out how many `samples` (i.e., instances) are there in each of the dataset?
5. How many columns are there in each of the 3 datasets?
6. Compute the mean of the last (i.e., rightmost) column of `week-01/datasets/C.csv`?
7. Where (i.e, in which sample) the two datasets: `week-01/datasets/B.txt` and `week-01/datasets/D.txt` differ?
8. What is the average credit score among the samples found in `week-01/datasets/A.csv`?
9. How many different countries are listed in `week-01/datasts/A.csv`?
10. Please briefly describe each of the 3 datasets (i.e., what the datasets are about)
11. Care to explore more of the datasets?
